# Description

This is a web application that allows people to create video challenges that others can join and try to complete. A person, creating a challenge,
needs to upload a video description so that other people understand what is it all about. After completing a challenge, a video response can be uploaded
by a participant, showing that a challenge was completed. Challenge creator can accept or reject such response, granting points or deleting response if it failed.

Since this application is tightly coupled with facebook, challenges may have different visibilities, being public or strictly for a chosen group of friends. Videos are being
uploaded to users facebook accounts, using facebook api.
